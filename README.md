# GOV.UK Pay Payment Plugin

This plugin provides a payment option for Indico's payment module using the
GOV.UK Pay API.

When used, the user will be sent to the relevant GOV.UK pay portal to make the payment, and afterwards
they are automatically sent back to Indico.

## Credits

Heavily based on the PayPal plugin and SixPay plugin within Indico-plugins managed by the CERN Indico Team.
